    "A scientist works with a colony of many thousands of mice. The average weight of all the mice is known to be 19.5 grammes with SD 3.4 grammes. She asks her first lab assistant to select 22 mice for an experiment, but is concerned that the selection of the mice may not be truly random and is instead is biased in some way. The selected mice may have been those that were slowest in avoiding the assistant, and this might influence the outcome of the experiment. The weights of the mice selected by the first assistant are as follows:\n",

    "In a second study, our researcher reads a report that in a survey 81.5% of people reported that they felt it is important to wear masks when travelling on London buses. However, she fears that a recent news story has undermined people's willingness to wear masks. She wishes to test whether the proportion of people now wearing masks on London buses is lower than this number. She conducts a study where a random selection of bus commuters are observed and it is recorded whether or not they are wearing a mask. She observes 1554 people wearing masks appropriately, 420 not wearing masks, and 33 wearing masks inappropriately. She decides that those wearing masks inappropriately should be excluded as they do not inform either way about the hypothesis.\n",
