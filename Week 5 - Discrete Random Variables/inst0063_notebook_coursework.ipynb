    "\n",
    "When an exam or assessment has resulted in unusually low (or high) mark across the whole cohort, some people consider it fairer to adjust the (numerical) marks to ensure that a more typical (or expected) distribution of (alphabetical) grades are achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to achieve this is to have a preferred distribution of alphabetical grades then define an adjusted mark, $y_i$, for each student $i$ based on the original mark, $x_i$, such that the  mean and standard deviation of the new marks $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ follows the desired distribution as closely as possible. We'll call this rebasing. This adjustment would involve first standardising each mark from $x_i$ to $z_i$ (where $\\{z_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ are assumed to have mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$), then reversing the standardisation operation on $z_i$ to give $y_i$, where $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ has the new mean and new standard deviation. You can again assume (with the y marks) that a student falling precisely on the boundary will get the higher grade.\n",

    "1. If we assume that the distribution of original marks, $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ is approximately symmetrically distributed.\n",
    "  * a) What should the mean,  $\\mu_y$, of the new marks, $\\{y_i\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be? (Even if you do not think the data satisfies this assumption.)\n",
    "  * b) Given your mean from the previous part, and assuming the data is approximately normally distributed. How would you now choose your standard deviation for the new marks? Consider that if our $y_i$ values are normally distributed we can calculate with high accuracy the proportion of data greater than some number of standard deviations above the mean. (Again, you should give an answer even if you do not think the data satisfies this assumption.)\n",
    "3. Using your mean and standard deviation from part A.3 standardise the marks from assessment 1 so that the resulting values have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Histogram the data and calculate the mean and SD to check this is successful.\n",
    "4. Set the target mean and standard deviation for the $y_i$ values you specify in E.1 and E.2 to appropriate variables. Now reverse the standardisation process on the $z_i$ values to give the $y_i$ values. Output the sample mean and standard deviation calculated on your new marks to check this was successful.\n",
    "5. Show graphically the distribution of the new marks both as a histogram and as a bar chart showing proportions of the cohort within each grade boundary. Also output (with the print statement) the probabilities of being in each grade category (A, B, C and (F)ailing) to 2 decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answers to 1. a) and b). should be written in the Markdown block directly below. For these, you do not have to give numerical solutions based on any data. Simply show things symbolically for a general set of marks. Answers to E.2 onwards should be written in the code block below the Markdown."

For some of the questions above, you may know how to calculate a good candidate boundary, but due to marks falling precisely on the boundary, you may have to also consider nearby boundaries so see if they give better proportions. If you need to explore a large number of boundaries, try using a `for` loop to consider a relatively small number of nearby boundaries with a few lines of code.
