    "\n",
    "This is, I believe asking about a system in which a defendent is \"innocent until proven guilty\". Under such a sytems, the default belief (null hypothesis) is that the defendent is guilty. If there is insufficient evidence to come to a guilty verdict then the defendent should be pronounced \"not guilty\". So hypothesis B should be our null hypothesis and hypothesis A our alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is no catagorical answer to this, but let's explore a few ideas. I don't claim to be a legal expert, so this analysis should be interpreted with that in mind. I am basing my answers on statistics I found in *Court Statistics for England and Wales (2019), Georgina Sturge. Number CBP 8372. House of Commons Library* (see [here](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8372/CBP-8372.pdf)).\n",

    "There appear to be 27000 initial hearings for cases that can only be resolved by trial in the Crown Courts, so we'll use that as a rough estimate of the number of trials each year where we need to come to some conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendent. We know that a hypothesis test at a significance level $\\alpha$ has a probability $\\alpha$ of rejecting the null hypothesis when it should not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say (for simplicity) that roughly 50% of the defendents are innocent, that is 13500 hypothesis tests where the null hypothesis holds. As our null hypothesis is the innocence of the defendent, then rejecting this means finding an innocent person guilty and could have a serious impact on that person's life. We would therefore like to ensure the number of innocent defendents found guilty is small, but we cannot guarantee that this will never happen otherwise we would never convict a guilty person (there may always be some uncertainty). Moreover, the stricter we make our significance level, the fewer guilty people we will convict. The table below shows a series of significance levels alongside the mean number of innocent people where, by chance, there is sufficient evidence to find them guilty at that significance level.\n",

    "The standard drug is effective 72% of the time, so the probability is $p_0 = 0.72$. The new drug is tested on a sample of $n=50$ and is effective in $x=42$ cases. We wish to know whether this is sufficient evidence to \"prove\" that the new drug is more effective. This suggest the following one sided test with:\n",
